## What's Centaur?

Centaur is infrastructure for teams that want to deploy AI agents to their organization — in Slack, on the web, or via API — with shared tools, durable multi-step workflows, and security that doesn't require trusting the agent with your keys.

1. **Collaboration-first**: Deploy an agent your whole team can talk to. Users interact via [Slack](services/slackbot/) or the [REST API](AGENTS.md#service-interface-contracts) directly. Each conversation gets its own isolated sandbox, but tools, workflows, and knowledge are shared across the organization. Add a new tool or workflow and everyone has access immediately — no per-user setup.

2. **Durable workflows**: Compose multi-step agent pipelines that survive crashes and span hours or days. [Checkpoint/replay](AGENTS.md#durable-workflows) means you can `sleep` for five minutes between polling iterations, `wait_for_event` from an external webhook, or chain parent→child agent turns — all with exactly-once step execution. Cron schedules, external events, and child workflows are built in. Just drop a Python file in [`workflows/`](workflows/).

3. **Defense in depth**: Each conversation runs in an isolated Docker container on an internal-only network. A [MITM proxy](services/firewall/) injects credentials at the network boundary — the agent never holds them directly. The firewall enforces per-host credential scoping, HTTP method restrictions, SSRF protection, rate limiting, response scanning for leaked secrets, and structured audit logging. A compromised container can still make authenticated requests through the proxy, but it can't extract credentials, reach internal services, or operate undetected.

4. **Harness-agnostic**: Not locked to a single AI runtime. Run [Amp](https://ampcode.com), Claude Code, Codex, or any CLI-based agent inside the sandbox. The sandbox image ships with Node.js, Rust, Python, and git — agents can `git clone`, `cargo build`, and run tests in a real Linux environment.

5. **Extensible by design**: Convention-based Python [tool plugins](tools/) (60+) and [durable workflow plugins](workflows/) are auto-discovered and hot-reloaded — no core code changes to extend the system. The [`centaur_sdk`](centaur_sdk/) is a standalone pip-installable package for building tools outside the repo. Private extensions via submodule + docker-compose override — no fork required.

6. **Observable by default**: Every service writes structured JSON to stdout. [Fluent Bit](services/fluentbit/) auto-discovers all containers (including ephemeral agent sandboxes) and ships logs to [VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/). Metrics push to [VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/). The [firewall](services/firewall/) emits audit events for every outbound request. Query everything in [Grafana](services/grafana/) or via [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) CLI.

Centaur's entire security-critical core is **~5,400 lines of Python**: the [API](services/api/) (3,900), [firewall](services/firewall/) (1,000), and [secrets manager](services/secrets/) (470). That's what runs your agents, guards your keys, and enforces isolation. Everything else — 60+ [tool plugins](tools/), [durable workflows](AGENTS.md#durable-workflows), a [Slack interface](services/slackbot/), infra config — is a leaf-node integration that doesn't touch auth, secrets, or sandbox boundaries.

## Durable Workflows

The workflow engine uses checkpoint/replay — the handler function IS the workflow, and steps are checkpointed to Postgres. On resume after crash or suspension, the handler re-executes top-to-bottom but skips steps that already have results. Loops, branches, and conditionals work naturally because it's just Python.

```python
# workflows/my_workflow.py — drop this file in and it's live
WORKFLOW_NAME = "my_workflow"

async def handler(inp, ctx):
    data = await ctx.step("fetch", lambda: fetch_data(inp.query))
    await ctx.sleep("wait", timedelta(minutes=5))
    result = await ctx.run_agent("analyze", text=f"Summarize: {data}")
    return {"data": data, "analysis": result}
```

**Primitives**: `ctx.step()` (exactly-once execution), `ctx.sleep()` / `ctx.sleep_until()` (durable suspend), `ctx.wait_for_event()` (external webhook), `ctx.run_agent()` (spawn a child agent turn), `ctx.run_workflow()` (child workflow). Cron and interval schedules are built in.

**REST API**: `POST /workflows/runs` (create), `GET /workflows/runs/{id}` (inspect), `POST /workflows/runs/{id}/cancel`, `POST /workflows/events` (deliver external events to waiting runs).

See the [Developer Guide](AGENTS.md#durable-workflows) for full API reference, built-in workflows, and the WorkflowContext API.

## How It Compares

| | Centaur | OpenClaw | IronClaw |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Process model** | 1 conversation = 1 isolated Docker container | Single Node.js process, full system access | WASM sandbox per tool |
| **Secrets** | MITM proxy injection — agent can't extract keys, but can make calls through the proxy | `~/.openclaw/credentials/` with file perms | Host boundary injection (WASM only) |
| **Blast radius** | Container on internal-only network, method-filtered, rate-limited | Agent has shell, filesystem, browser, credentials | WASM sandbox, limited to declared capabilities |
| **Audit logging** | Every outbound request audit-logged via firewall; all container logs auto-collected into VictoriaLogs | None built-in | None built-in |
| **Agent runtime** | Harness-agnostic (Amp, Claude Code, Codex, any CLI) | Locked to OpenClaw's runtime | Locked to IronClaw's runtime |
| **Real engineering** | Full Linux sandbox — `git clone`, `cargo build`, run tests | Yes (but with full host access) | WASM — can't run arbitrary code |
| **Tools & skills** | API-mediated plugins + [`SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/) workflow instructions, hot-reloadable | 100+ AgentSkills with local access | WASM tools, hot-loadable |

## Security Model

Centaur's security is defense in depth — no single layer is a silver bullet, but the combination makes compromise expensive and detectable.

### What an attacker cannot do

- **Extract credentials**: The agent never holds real API keys. Credentials exist only in the secrets manager on an isolated network (`secrets_net`) that only the firewall can reach. The firewall injects real secret values into HTTP headers in-flight. Sandbox containers see only key _names_ as placeholder values (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY=OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment) — the real secret values never appear in the container's environment, filesystem, or memory.

- **Move laterally**: Sandbox containers live on `agent_net`, an internal Docker network. SSRF protection blocks requests to private IPs by resolving hostnames before forwarding. The database, secrets manager, and observability stack are on separate networks the sandbox cannot reach. Redirect responses to internal IPs are also blocked.

- **Use credentials on the wrong host**: Tools declare which API hosts and secret keys they need in their `pyproject.toml`. The API builds a host→keys injection map and pushes it to the firewall. A Slack tool's token can't be injected into an Etherscan request — the firewall strips unmatched key placeholders and logs the violation.

- **Escalate privileges**: Each container gets an HMAC-SHA256 signed token (`sbx1.*`) bound to its thread and container ID, time-limited to 2 hours, with scopes restricted to `agent` and `tools:*` only. No admin access, no secrets endpoints, no key management. Database-backed API keys enforce fine-grained scopes (`admin`, `agent:execute`, `tools:<name>`, `threads:read`).

- **Smuggle key names past the firewall**: The firewall applies NFKC unicode normalization, strips zero-width characters, and maps Cyrillic/Greek homoglyphs before scanning for key name placeholders. Header values that don't match the outbound allowlist are stripped entirely. User-Agent is forced to a fixed value.

- **Operate undetected**: Every outbound request is audit-logged with method, host, path, status, request/response bytes, duration, and source container IP. Response bodies from LLM APIs are scanned for leaked secret values and redacted in real-time.

### What an attacker can do

- **Make authenticated requests through the proxy**: A compromised container can make API calls that the firewall will authenticate — this is by design, since the agent needs to call LLM APIs to function. The firewall limits this with HTTP method restrictions (non-allowlisted hosts are GET-only), per-source-IP rate limits (500 req/min default), and the injection map (credentials only go to declared hosts). But within those limits, a hijacked agent can make arbitrary calls to any API host it's authorized for.

- **Call any registered tool**: The agent can invoke any tool via the API. Centaur scopes tool access per API key, but sandboxes currently get `tools:*` scope which grants access to all registered tools.

- **Read data returned by API calls and tools**: The agent sees full responses from LLM APIs and tools it invokes. Response scanning redacts known secret values, but the agent sees all other data.

- **Potentially root the container**: The sandbox is a Docker container, not a VM. Container escapes are a known risk class. Centaur mitigates with resource limits (4GB memory, 2 CPUs), read-only host mounts, and a proxied Docker socket that only allows container/network/exec operations. The Docker socket proxy is on a separate network that sandboxes cannot reach.

### Architecture decisions that enforce this

- **Scoped sandbox tokens**: HMAC-SHA256 signed, thread+container bound, 2-hour TTL, minted on spawn and refreshed when claiming from the warm pool.

- **Per-host injection maps**: Built from tool manifests, pushed to the firewall on startup and on every hot-reload. Wildcard host patterns (`*.domain.com`) are supported. Catch-all domains and raw IPs are rejected.

- **8 isolated Docker networks**: `default` (host-facing slackbot plus internal app traffic), `secrets_net` (firewall→secrets only), `secrets_egress` (secrets→1Password), `agent_net` (sandbox↔firewall↔API), `agent_egress` (sandbox direct egress for Amp DTW), `backend_net` (postgres/slackbot/api backplane), `control_net` (api↔pgbouncer↔firewall), and `obs_net` (monitoring).

- **Warm pool**: Pre-spawned containers eliminate ~15s cold-start latency. The pool auto-replenishes, recovers on API restart, and mints fresh scoped tokens on claim.

- **Tool REST API**: Tools auto-generate endpoints at `/tools/{name}/{method}` with scope-checked access and method introspection. The API serves as a hosted tool server — sandboxes call it via `curl`, no MCP protocol needed.
